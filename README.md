# Log-Periodic Antenna for Wireless Communication

This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antenna for wireless communication. The project explores wideband performance, high gain, and impedance stability using tools like ANSYS HFSS.

## Features
- **Wideband Operation**: Supports frequencies from 2 GHz to 7 GHz.
- **High Gain**: Achieves 6â€“10 dB gain across the band.
- **Simulation Tools**: ANSYS HFSS for electromagnetic design and optimization.
- **Compact Design**: Uses Roger RO4003C substrate for efficient performance.

## Files Included
- **Code**: Simulation files and scripts.
- **Graphs**: Results showing S11 parameters, gain plots, and performance comparisons.
- **Report**: [Project Report (PDF)](./Project-Report.pdf).

## Key Results
- **Impedance Matching**: S11 parameter below -10 dB across the frequency band.
- **Applications**: Suitable for 5G, IoT, and RF energy harvesting.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in ANSYS HFSS.
2. Load the provided simulation files.
3. Adjust parameters as required to observe performance.
